Well some intresting facts about myself is that my favourite cuisine is Indian, as i have been eating in since my childhood being an Indian and i dont think any other cuisine for me is going to beat that. One of my hobby that i can never give up is playing or watching cricket, as that sport is very close to my heart and is one the best hobby that i have ever had growing to this date. I dont usually watch movies, but if i do either it should be based on real life incidents or the movie would have bagged a crazy amount of attention where every one or the other and there is this one specific movie "The Seize Of Jadotville" is the one i love the most, i dont think i would ever be bored watching that even after i have seen it over 10 times.
